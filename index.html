        <h1>Hi! Here's the rules of this game</h1>
        <h2>1: Grab a single die and a friend</h2>
        <p>
          All you need to play a game of pig dice is a single die and a friend
          (or more)!
        </p>
        <h2>3: Play the first turn<br />Roll the die to start the turn</h2>
        <p>
          The first player(person who has lighter part of screen) rolls a single
          die to begin the game. Their goal is to roll a number 2-6 to score
          points, and avoid rolling a one, which ends their turn. If the player
          has a scoring roll, theyâ€™re faced with a decision!
        </p>
        <h2>Choose to reroll OR bank the score</h2>
        <p>
          Every turn ends in one of two ways. A player rolls a one during the
          turn and scores zero points for the turn, or the player banks their
          score after a point scoring roll (2-6).
        </p>
        <h2>
          4: Continue taking turns until one player earns 100 points and wins
          the game
        </h2>
        <p>
          During the second and subsequent rounds, the turns continue as
          outlined above. However, scoring is cumulative across all rounds and
          the first player to achieve 100 points wins the game. Rolling a 1 does
          not wipe out points banked in previous rounds.
